# Start the Damn Movie

TF2 plugin that patches the `startmovie` command to record even while console is open.
You will still see a `frames will record after console is cleared` message,
but the recording will start immediately.

## Installation

1. Download the
   [latest release](https://github.com/jooonior/StartTheDamnMovie/releases/latest/download/StartTheDamnMovie.zip)
   and extract it into your `tf/custom` directory.
2. Add `-insecure` to your launch options to enable loading plugins.

You should see a console message about the plugin loading when TF2 starts.
